# Service-Now-suite-automation-
A simple script to automate Service Now (Snow) suite's incident acknowledgement from your browser.

This is a script I wrote for my brother to automate incident(ticket) acknowledgement.

Snow, itself is a automation suite. So, im sure this can be done in their server side as well

I choose SMS to let my brother know when an incident has been acknowledged, as he will let the script run and go away.

You can choose your own way of knowing the progress.
